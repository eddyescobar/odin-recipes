        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pizza dough recipe that I will probably end up making.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Making the Pizza Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
                
                <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
                
                <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>

                <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>

                <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>

                <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
                
                <p>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</p>
                
                <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>
                
                <p>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
                
                <p>For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).</p>
                
                <p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</p>
